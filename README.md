Veggie Timer based off Tomato Timer
By Default Already has one full corn just to show an example.
Every 30 min you work will greet you with an alarm and ability 
to silence alarm, take a 5 min break, or stop working.
Once you get 3 colored corns plus the example one you get the option for a longer break.
